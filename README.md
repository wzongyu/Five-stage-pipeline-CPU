# Five-stage-pipeline-CPU

- This project is based on a simple five-stage pipeline implemented in Lab 4 of the "Computer Organization" course
- The original implementation has been partially expanded to 57 instructions, including 8 logical operations, 6 shift instructions, 4 data move instructions, 14 arithmetic operations, 12 branch jump instructions, 8 access instructions, 2 trap instructions and 3 privileged instructions.
- Passed the first 52 instructions for functional testing and on-boarding

Successfully passed the test!
